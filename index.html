          <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
          <p class="subtitle">
            I’m Carlos Ramirez, a software developer with a focus on back-end logic and clean, 
            efficient code. I enjoy building systems that make complex tasks simple, from database-driven applications 
            to process automation. My goal is to keep improving as a developer while contributing to projects that make 
            a real impact.
          </p>

          <h2>Core Skills and Focus Areas</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">
            My main strengths are in back-end programming and data management. I’m experienced with languages like 
            Python, C++, and Java, and I’ve worked with both SQL and SQLite databases. I’m comfortable designing 
            logical workflows, connecting APIs, and writing code that keeps things running smoothly behind the scenes.
          </p>

          <h2>My Mindset</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">
            I approach every project with an emphasis on clarity and structure. Whether I’m debugging, optimizing 
            queries, or designing code architecture, I aim to make each component understandable, reusable, and 
            maintainable. I like when my code makes life easier for both users and other developers.
          </p>

          <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">
            Before focusing on programming, I gained experience in hands-on work environments such as welding and 
            shipping logistics. Those roles taught me attention to detail, reliability, and how to stay organized 
            under pressure — skills I’ve carried into my development work.
