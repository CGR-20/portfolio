                When it comes to programming, my passion lies in backend 
                development. I enjoy creating efficient, reliable, and 
                scalable server-side applications that power the functionality
                of web and software systems.
                I revel in being given complex problems to solve, and I take 
                pride in writing clean, maintainable code that allows me to 
                easily edit, modify, and expand upon my work as needed.

            <strong>Highlights</strong>
              <p>
                Earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, building a strong foundation in 
                software development principles and problem-solving.
            </p>
              <p>
                Studied established software design patterns as part of my education, informing how 
                I structure and maintain backend code going forward.
            </p>
              <p>
                Developed and deployed backend applications in Linux environments using the command 
                line and common system tools.

                <h3>KXI Compiler Project</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed and implemented a compiler for KXI, a 
                    custom, simplified Java-like language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using lexical analysis, semantic checking, and AST 
                    generation, the compiler translates KXI code into 
                    custom assembly code
                </p>
                <p>
                    (which is run though it's appropriate processor and 
                    assembler that were written for another project).

                <h3>Processor & Assembler Project</h3>
                <p>
                    The microprocessor, built in C++, emulates the process of 
                    executing custom bytecode given to it via a bytecode file,
                    which if written properly will execute a program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The assembler, built in Python, translates custom assembly 
                    code into the bytecode that the processor can read and 
                    execute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both programs work together to allow users to write and 
                    execute programs in a low-level assembly language.

                <h3>Dynamic Bit Array Project</h3>
                <p>
                    A program that implements a dynamic bit array data 
                    structure, allowing for efficient storage and manipulation 
                    of bits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It supports operations such as setting, clearing, toggling, 
                    and querying individual bits, as well as resizing the array 
                    dynamically as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project demonstrates an understanding of low-level 
                    data manipulation and memory management in C++.

            <p>
                A simple database showcasing the use of SQLite to manage
                company employee data.
            </p>
            <p>
                It includes tables for employees, departments, and roles,
                along with SQL queries to perform CRUD operations that give .
                insight into company data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shell scripts are used to set up the database and execute
                various operations.
